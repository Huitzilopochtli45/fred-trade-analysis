# 📘 Macroeconomic Analysis Plan — Phase 3: Interpretation and Modeling

This phase outlines the core objectives, techniques, and workflows for analyzing the master macroeconomic dataset built from quarterly indicators (1972–present). This plan is structured to extract meaningful economic relationships, cycles, volatility, and regime patterns from the 22 aligned macro series.

---

## 🎯 Goal

To uncover dynamic relationships across monetary, fiscal, labor, production, consumption, and housing sectors through time, and to explore how these relationships evolve across different macroeconomic regimes.

## 🧩 Dataset Overview

- **Time span:** Q1 1972 – Present
- **Frequency:** Quarterly
- **Columns:** 22 core macro indicators
- **Dimensions covered:**
  - GDP, GNP, Exports, Imports
  - Interest rates, Inflation
  - Fiscal outlays/receipts
  - Labor, production, consumption, housing

---

## 🔍 Phase 3 Workflows

### 1. 📊 Descriptive and Structural Overview
- Summary statistics (mean, std, skew, kurtosis)
- Correlation matrix (static + rolling)
- Missing value audit and any temporal gaps

### 2. 🔁 Growth and Volatility Analysis
- Compute and visualize quarterly growth rates
- Compute rolling standard deviations and volatilities
- Rank variables by trend stability vs cyclicality

### 3. 🔄 Cyclical Decomposition
- Hodrick-Prescott filter or Baxter-King filter
- Separate trend and cycle for GDP, GNP, Production, etc.
- Compare phase alignment of major cycles

### 4. 🧠 Regime-Specific Analysis
- Segment the dataset into macroeconomic regimes:
  - **Inflation/Volcker Era (1971–1985)**
  - **Globalization Boom (1985–2001)**
  - **China-WTO Expansion (2001–2020)**
  - **COVID & Reshoring (2020–present)**
- Compare how **GDP divergence** and **Net Export dynamics** evolve within each regime
- Evaluate macro structural relationships per period:
  - Trade vs growth dependency
  - Labor-market vs consumption shifts
  - Inflation vs monetary reaction

### 5. 🧠 Correlation and Lag Detection
- Cross-correlation function (CCF) matrix
- Lead-lag detection across pairs (e.g., savings rate → GDP)
- Heatmaps of correlations across macro groups

### 6. 💡 Policy Impact Mapping
- Overlay known fiscal/monetary events
- Compare divergence vs convergence of macro signals
- Time alignment of rate changes with GDP, housing, unemployment

---

## 📦 Output Goals

- Clean visuals (time plots, heatmaps, phase plots)
- A master correlation and lag map
- Summary tables per regime
- Exportable notebook for reproducibility

---

## 🧭 Next Step

Begin with correlation + growth rate visualizations for core sectors (GDP, consumption, labor) before rolling into deeper phase-based or model-based tools.
