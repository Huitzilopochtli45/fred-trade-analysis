# üìò Phase 1: Fresh Macroeconomic Data Gathering Plan

This plan outlines a complete restart of the macroeconomic data pipeline, focused on clean, quarterly-aligned acquisition from reliable FRED sources. The goal is to create a consistent and comprehensive dataset for economic analysis from Q1 1972 to present.

## üéØ Objective

To build a clean, extensible macroeconomic dataset from scratch using quarterly FRED series covering real output, inflation, labor, trade, fiscal policy, consumption, housing, and interest rates.

## üß≠ Workflow Plan

1. **Pull Data**: Use `fredapi` to fetch each series
2. **Resample**: Ensure quarterly frequency
3. **Trim**: Cut to `1972-03-31` start for consistent coverage
4. **Save**:
   - Each series to individual CSV
   - Optionally consolidate to multi-tab Excel
5. **Directory Layout**:
   - `/data/raw` ‚Äî original FRED pulls
   - `/data/quarterly` ‚Äî trimmed & cleaned quarterly data

---

## ‚úÖ Deliverables

- Raw and resampled data files per series
- Consistent `Date` column (quarter-end)
- Fully aligned datasets for master table merge

---

## üß± Next Step

Generate the data collection script to fetch, resample, and organize all listed series.
